## Introduction[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#introduction)

The root cause of waste management in Nairobi is how the waste is collected, and setting up proper
waste collection mechanisms. Setting up a common platform for waste collectors and waste
producers such as households and mini industries such as schools will be the proper way to go.
Having the collectors and distributors under one roof will eliminate the challenge of heaping the data
on the roadside until the county government or private collectors come to collect the waste.
Modern problems require modern solutions. Creating a platform that connects both the waste collector and the waste disposer is essential to get rid of this challenge. Okoa waste will be able to allow a user to create a waste collection order which will trigger a waste collector to be assigned to them.

**[Okoa Waste](greenly.vercel.app/)** is an open source waste management platform that allows users to order waste collection from the company

Have a look at the official [Okoa Waste](greenly.vercel.app/) for a comprehensive list of Sulu's features, core values and use cases.

## Motivation[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#motivation)

Solid waste collection in Nairobi is conducted on two levels:
**County government** - The Nairobi county government is responsible for collecting waste from
public locations such as markets, streets, and roads, and any other public space such as stadiums.
They are conducted at the expense of the taxpayer.
**Private collectors** - These individuals and organizations collect waste from individual households
that conduct business with them and small-scale industries such as schools and dispensaries, their
services are conducted at a fee.


The existing waste collection methods used by waste collectors and waste collection companies largely depend on the presence of the waste disposer and waste collector, if one of the parties is not available during the waste collection exercise that is set on specific days of the week then the waste is not collected and can end up being piled in the bin.
